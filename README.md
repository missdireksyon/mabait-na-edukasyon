## Possible FAQs
> Why did you make a whole repository/website for this?
Actually I didn't really want to but this is the best way for me to learn how to code as well as be able to share my flashcard links I worked so hard for
> Are these links free to use?
Yes, all links go directly to shared decks but may **require sign-up** to use
> Will you add more subjects later?
Only the ones listed will be addded sooner or later. Anything else besides that I can no longer guarantee
> Will you share them on Kahoot, Quizlet, Quizziz, Google Forms, and other apps or sites?
I will only share them on Noji, StudyKit, Gizmo, and Anki. You may, however, download the decks and import them into your app or site of your choosing.
> Where can I contact you?
You can contact me on **Discord** (miscdirecion) or on **Github** (missdireksyon), or even **Messenger**.

## ‚òÖ Possible FAQs ‚òÖ
> ‚ùì **Why did you make a whole repository/website for this?**

Actually I didn't really want to but this is the best way for me to learn how to code as well as be able to share my flashcard links I worked so hard for.

> ‚ùì **Are these links free to use?**

Yes, all links go directly to shared decks but may **require sign-up** to use.

> ‚ùì **Will you add more subjects later?**

Only the ones listed will be addded sooner or later. Anything else besides that I can no longer guarantee.

> ‚ùì **Will you share them on Kahoot, Quizlet, Quizziz, Google Forms, and other apps or sites?**

I will only share them on Noji, StudyKit, Gizmo, and Anki. You may, however, download the decks and import them into your app or site of your choosing.

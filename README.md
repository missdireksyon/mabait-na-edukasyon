## ★ Possible FAQs ★
####❓Why did you make a whole repository/website for this?
Actually I didn't really want to but this is the best way for me to learn how to code as well as be able to share my flashcard links I worked so hard for.

####❓Are these links free to use?
Yes, all links go directly to shared decks but may **require sign-up** to use.

####❓Will you add more subjects later?
Only the ones listed will be addded sooner or later. Anything else besides that I can no longer guarantee.

####❓Will you share them on Kahoot, Quizlet, Quizziz, Google Forms, and other apps or sites?**
I will only share them on Noji, StudyKit, Gizmo, ~~and Anki.~~ You may, however, download the decks and import them into your app or site of your choosing.
